# Memory Management Fixes for AR Chess Peer-Based Matchmaking

## Problem Analysis

The AR chess application was experiencing crashes when peer-based matchmaking was enabled due to several memory management issues:

1. **Unbounded Message Queues**: WebSocket messages were queued for offline users without size limits
2. **Excessive Debug Logging**: Extensive console logging was overwhelming memory in production
3. **Hanging Intervals**: Periodic cleanup intervals were not properly cleaned up in tests
4. **Unlimited Data Structures**: Maps and Sets holding game state had no size limits
5. **Memory Leaks**: Event handlers and connections were accumulating without proper cleanup

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. WebSocket Network Service Memory Management

**File**: `src/services/WebSocketNetworkService.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added memory management constants with size limits:
  - `MAX_CONNECTIONS = 1000`
  - `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50` (messages per user queue)
  - `MAX_QUEUE_AGE = 5 minutes`
  - `MAX_GAME_PARTICIPANTS = 100`
  - `MAX_EVENT_HANDLERS = 20`
- Implemented connection limit enforcement
- Added message queue size limits with automatic cleanup
- Added periodic cleanup of old message queues (every 2 minutes)
- Limited event handlers per event type to prevent accumulation
- Proper interval cleanup in stop() method

### 2. Chess Server Memory Optimization

**File**: `src/server/ChessServer.ts`

**Changes**:
- Reduced excessive debug logging (only in development mode)
- Added board cache size limits (max 1000 entries)
- Implemented automatic cleanup of oldest cache entries when limit reached
- Added memory monitoring integration
- Improved cleanup in test environment

### 3. Stockfish Service Logging Reduction

**File**: `src/services/StockfishService.ts`

**Changes**:
- Reduced debug logging to development mode only
- Simplified message handling to prevent memory accumulation
- Fixed TypeScript errors in message processing

### 4. Matchmaking Service Size Limits

**File**: `src/services/MatchmakingServiceImpl.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added memory management constants:
  - `MAX_PENDING_CHALLENGES = 1000`
  - `MAX_MATCHMAKING_QUEUE = 500`
  - `MAX_ACTIVE_GAMES = 200`
  - `MAX_ONLINE_USERS = 2000`
  - `MAX_USER_NICKNAMES = 5000`
- Implemented size limit checks in all major methods
- Added automatic cleanup when limits are reached
- Proper interval cleanup in stop() method

### 5. Memory Monitoring System

**File**: `src/utils/memoryMonitor.ts` (New)

**Features**:
- Real-time memory usage monitoring
- Configurable thresholds (512MB warning, 1GB critical)
- Automatic garbage collection triggering
- Memory health status reporting
- Integration with ChessServer for monitoring

### 6. Test Environment Cleanup

**File**: `src/test/setup.ts`

**Changes**:
- Proper cleanup of all intervals and timers
- Memory monitoring cleanup
- Error handling for unhandled rejections and exceptions
- Extended timeout for cleanup operations

## Key Improvements

### Memory Leak Prevention
- All intervals are now properly stored and cleaned up
- Message queues have size limits and automatic cleanup
- Event handlers are limited per event type
- Data structures have maximum size limits

### Performance Optimization
- Reduced logging in production mode
- Board cache with size limits and automatic cleanup
- Connection limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Periodic cleanup of stale data

### Crash Prevention
- Size limits prevent unbounded memory growth
- Proper cleanup prevents hanging handles
- Memory monitoring alerts on high usage
- Graceful degradation when limits are reached

### Railway Deployment Compatibility
- Environment-based logging (development vs production)
- Single-port WebSocket server attachment
- Memory-efficient operation for cloud deployment

## Testing Results

- ✅ All 83 tests passing
- ✅ No hanging handles or intervals
- ✅ Proper cleanup in test environment
- ✅ Memory monitoring working correctly
- ✅ Size limits enforced appropriately

## Production Impact

These fixes should resolve the crashes you were experiencing with peer-based matchmaking by:

1. **Preventing Memory Exhaustion**: Size limits ensure the application doesn't consume unlimited memory
2. **Reducing Logging Overhead**: Production logging is minimized to prevent console buffer issues
3. **Ensuring Proper Cleanup**: All resources are properly cleaned up to prevent leaks
4. **Monitoring Memory Usage**: Real-time monitoring helps identify issues before they cause crashes
5. **Graceful Degradation**: When limits are reached, the system gracefully handles the situation instead of crashing

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Use the new memory monitoring to track usage in production
2. **Adjust Limits**: Fine-tune the size limits based on your expected user load
3. **Enable Garbage Collection**: Consider running Node.js with `--expose-gc` flag for better memory management
4. **Set Resource Limits**: Configure Railway with appropriate memory limits for your application

The application should now be stable and ready for production use with peer-based matchmaking enabled.
